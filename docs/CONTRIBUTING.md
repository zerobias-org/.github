## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of compliance frameworks
- Familiarity with YAML/JSON format
- GitHub account

### Repository Structure

Our compliance packages are organized into four main types:

1. **Vendor** - Organizations that publish standards
2. **Suite** - Specific regulations or standards
3. **Framework** - Versioned implementations
4. **Crosswalk** - Mappings between frameworks

## Types of Contributions

### 1. New Vendor

Add a new organization that publishes compliance standards.

**Example**: Adding Sony Pictures as a vendor for their security standards.

### 2. New Suite

Add a new regulation or standard from an existing vendor.

**Example**: Adding a new privacy regulation from a state government.

### 3. New Framework

Add a specific version of a compliance framework.

**Example**: Adding ISO 27001:2022 as a new framework version.

### 4. Crosswalk Mappings

Create or improve mappings between different frameworks.

**Example**: Mapping NIST controls to ISO 27001 requirements.

## Artifact Structure

Each artifact type has a specific structure. See our detailed documentation:

- [Vendor Structure](artifact-types/vendor.md)
- [Suite Structure](artifact-types/suite.md)
