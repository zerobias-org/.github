# Zerobias Organization

Welcome to Zerobias! We're building the next generation of compliance automation tools.

## Our Projects

### Compliance Framework Packages
We maintain a comprehensive ecosystem of compliance framework packages:

- **Vendor Packages**: Organizations that publish compliance standards (NIST, ISO, etc.)
- **Suite Packages**: Specific regulations and standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.)
- **Framework Packages**: Versioned implementations of compliance frameworks
- **Crosswalk Packages**: Mappings between different compliance frameworks

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! You can help by:

1. **Suggesting New Artifacts**: Propose new vendors, suites, or frameworks
2. **Improving Mappings**: Help us improve crosswalk mappings between frameworks
3. **Reporting Issues**: Found a problem? Let us know!
